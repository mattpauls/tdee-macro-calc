# tdee-macro-calc
TDEE and macro calculator

Replaces the functionality of a few spreadsheets I use to calculate TDEE (Total Daily Estimated Expenditure) and macros for weight loss. Based off a general guide [here](https://thefitness.wiki/weight-loss-101/).

Inspired by the [nSuns TDEE spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QTWDxFaB0r-7U6vZmG1s8of7jwd2GHHi/edit#gid=770164572).

## TDEE
TDEE is the running average of daily calories. To lose weight, IN GENERAL, one must achieve a calorie deficit. Calculating a TDEE helps because it provides a baseline of current caloric intake to make decisions.

Once the current TDEE is calculated, a goal TDEE can be obtained by determining how much and how quickly weight should be lost. This goal TDEE is the number of calories one should eat in a day to achieve a relative calorie deficit and begin to lose weight.
